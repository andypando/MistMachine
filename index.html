            <p>Welcome to the Mist Machine platform. This service allows for the rapid develop of<br>
               "sideware" that will interact with the Mist API to perform operations that are not<br>
               currently supported in the portal.<br>
               <br>
               Use the navigation menu on the left to access various system functions.</p>

     <h2>Build sites from CSV</h2>
         <p>Allows the user to upload a .csv file with a name, address and note field. Order of the fields is <br>
         not important, in the second step you select the column to use for each element.<br>
         Working on API call to validate the address and return geo-location so maps are correct in portal.<br>
         Note: Working on a small bug, only works for Global 01 currently</p>
     <h2>Set Autoupgrade per Site</h2>
         <p>Allows the user to provide Org. ID and API Token to querry Org for list of sites. Then you have <br>
         the option to select the site to assign auto-upgrade firmware versions to. For each AP model you set<br>
         version you want, set the upgrade time, and set the upgrade day.</p>
     <h2>Get Complete Inventory Reports</h2>
         <p>Allows the user to provide Org. ID and API Token to querry Org for list of all inventory. It will then <br>
         sort the output into seperate .csv files based on type. This is helpful when you have switches in a VC <br>
         as the output from the Mist portal is not usable in the format provided. </p>
     <h2>Custom Site Upgrades</h2>
         <p>Allows the user to provide Org. ID and API Token to querry Org for list of sites. You can then select<br>
          the sites and upgrade method you wish to use on those sites. Big Bang, Serial, Canary or RRM <br>
          Note: Only Big Bang has been tested and it works, still need to test the other methods</p>
     <h2>Bulk Site Delete</h2>
         <p>Allows the user to provide Org. ID and API Token to querry Org for list of sites. You can then select<br>
         the ones you would like to delete from the Org</p>
